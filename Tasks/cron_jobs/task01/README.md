# Linux Backup Cron

Linux Backup Cron is a simple project aimed at automating the backup of important files on Linux systems using cron jobs. This project provides a basic backup script along with sample cron job configurations and documentation to help users set up automated backups on their systems.

## Features

- **Backup Script**: Provides a Bash script to create backups of specified files or directories using `rsync`.
- **Cron Job Configurations**: Includes sample cron job configuration files for scheduling the backup script to run automatically at specified intervals (e.g., daily, weekly, etc.).
- **Configuration Files**: Sample configuration files are provided for users to customize their backup preferences, such as source and destination directories, backup schedule, retention policy, etc.
- **Documentation**: Detailed documentation is available to guide users through the setup and configuration of the backup script and cron jobs. Examples and troubleshooting tips are included to help users get started.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the LinuxBackupCron repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LinuxBackupCron.git
    ```

2. **Customize Configuration**: Modify the `backup.sh` script and configuration files in the `config` directory according to your backup preferences.

3. **Set Up Cron Jobs**: Configure cron jobs using the sample cron job configuration files provided in the `config/cron` directory. Edit the cron jobs to specify the path to the `backup.sh` script and desired backup schedule.

4. **Test Backups**: Run test backups to ensure that the backup script is working correctly and that cron jobs are scheduled as expected.

5. **Monitor and Maintain**: Regularly monitor backup logs and verify that backups are running successfully. Adjust backup configurations and cron job schedules as needed.
